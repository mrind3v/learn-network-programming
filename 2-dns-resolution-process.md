# You Asked:

i wanted to understand the complete dns resolution process. chatgpt gave me this
"🌐 Complete DNS Resolution Process (for `www.example.com`)
==========================================================

We assume this is the **first time** the domain is being resolved:  
✅ **No cached entries** exist anywhere (browser, OS, recursive resolver, etc.).  
Therefore, the resolver must traverse the **entire DNS hierarchy**.

* * *

1\. DNS Hierarchy and Roles
---------------------------

| Layer / Component | Unique Authoritative Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Stub Resolver** (Client) | Part of OS/browser. Forwards queries. No authority. |
| **Recursive Resolver** | ISP/Google/Cloudflare DNS. Orchestrates full lookup, caches results. No authority itself. |
| **Root Servers** | Authoritative for the **root zone (“.”)**. Direct queries to TLD servers. |
| **TLD Servers** | Authoritative for TLD zones (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.). Direct queries to domain NS. |
| **Authoritative Servers** | Final authority for the domain (e.g., `example.com`). Provide actual IP records (A/AAAA). |

* * *

2\. Step-by-Step DNS Resolution (No Cache Anywhere)
---------------------------------------------------

### 🔹 Step 1: Browser/Stub Resolver

*   User types `www.example.com` in browser.
    
*   Browser cache → **empty**.
    
*   OS stub resolver cache → **empty**.
    
*   Forwards query to the configured recursive resolver (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
    

* * *

### 🔹 Step 2: Recursive Resolver → Root Server

*   Recursive resolver cache → **empty**.
    
*   Sends query to a Root DNS server:
    
    > "What is the IP for `www.example.com`?"
    
*   **Root server’s authoritative role**:
    
    *   Authoritative **only for the root zone (“.”)**.
        
    *   Responds:  
        → "I don’t know the IP, but `.com` TLD servers can help."
        

* * *

### 🔹 Step 3: Recursive Resolver → `.com` TLD Server

*   Recursive resolver queries a `.com` TLD server.
    
*   **TLD server’s authoritative role**:
    
    *   Authoritative **only for `.com` domains**.
        
    *   Responds:  
        → "I don’t know the IP, but here are the authoritative servers for `example.com`."
        

* * *

### 🔹 Step 4: Recursive Resolver → Authoritative Server for `example.com`

*   Recursive resolver queries `ns1.example-dns.com`.
    
*   **Authoritative server’s role**:
    
    *   Authoritative **only for `example.com` zone**.
        
    *   Responds with the final record:  
        → "`www.example.com` → 93.184.216.34"
        

* * *

### 🔹 Step 5: Response and Caching

*   Recursive resolver caches the result (TTL applies).
    
*   Sends answer back to stub resolver → OS → Browser.
    
*   Browser uses IP to connect to the web server.
    

* * *

3\. ASCII Flow Diagram
----------------------

    User types "www.example.com"
             |
    [Stub Resolver] (no cache)
             |
             v
    [Recursive Resolver] (no cache)
             |
             v
    [Root Server]  -- authoritative for "."
        → Referral to ".com" TLD servers
             |
             v
    [TLD Server]  -- authoritative for ".com"
        → Referral to "example.com" NS
             |
             v
    [Authoritative Server for example.com]
        → "www.example.com = 93.184.216.34"
             |
             v
    [Recursive Resolver caches + replies]
             |
             v
    [Stub Resolver → Browser → Web Server]
    

* * *

4\. Caching (Optimization for Subsequent Queries)
-------------------------------------------------

Caching reduces repeated work:

*   **Browser cache**: Fastest (milliseconds).
    
*   **OS cache**: Shared by applications.
    
*   **Recursive resolver cache**: Prevents contacting root/TLD repeatedly.
    

**TTL (Time to Live):** Each record has an expiry time, after which it must be re-fetched.

👉 After the first lookup, the next user in the same ISP using the same resolver can resolve instantly from cache without hitting root/TLD.

* * *

5\. Redundancy and Load Balancing
---------------------------------

*   **Multiple servers** exist at each layer (root, TLD, authoritative).
    
*   **Anycast**: One IP → many physical servers (nearest responds).
    
*   **Round-robin DNS**: Multiple A records → responses rotate.
    
*   **Resolvers track performance stats**:
    
    *   Prefer servers with **low latency and high reliability**.
        
    *   Avoids overloading slow or failing servers.
        

* * *

6\. Cold Lookup vs Cached Lookup (Comparison)
---------------------------------------------

| Feature | First-Time (Cold Lookup) | Subsequent (Cached Lookup) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser Cache** | Empty → goes to OS | Direct hit → no network queries needed |
| **OS Cache** | Empty → forwards to recursive | OS answers immediately |
| **Recursive Resolver** | Empty → must query root → TLD → authoritative | Returns instantly from cache |
| **Network Latency** | High (multiple round trips: Root + TLD + Auth) | Very low (single response from cache) |
| **Load on DNS System** | High (involves all hierarchy layers) | Low (avoids contacting upstream servers) |
| **Time Taken** | 50–200ms depending on distance | 1–5ms typically |

* * *

✅ Final Refined Summary
=======================

When `"www.example.com"` is queried for the **first time** with **no cache anywhere**:

1.  Stub resolver asks recursive resolver.
    
2.  Recursive resolver queries **Root server** → referral to `.com` servers.
    
3.  Queries **TLD server** → referral to `example.com` authoritative servers.
    
4.  Queries **Authoritative server** → final answer (`93.184.216.34`).
    
5.  Recursive resolver caches result and responds to stub resolver.
    
6.  Browser connects using IP.
    

**Unique roles reminder:**

*   **Root** → only for the root zone (“.”).
    
*   **TLD** → only for TLD zones like `.com`.
    
*   **Authoritative** → final truth for a given domain.
    

Later queries are much faster due to **caching**, and reliability is ensured through **redundancy + resolver performance tracking**.

Would you like me to also **draw a second ASCII diagram showing the cached resolution path** (so you can visually compare the cold vs warm lookup)?
"


however, i do not know what stub resolver/ recursive resolvers are so it is a bit complex for me. can you give me a detailed explanation of the flow of dns resolution along with explanations to these terms when necessary. This is coming in my exam so i want to be able to answer any questions regarding it. Do not use too many analogies, as it becomes difficult to relate to real world. you can be technical, just that you must introduce the concept first

# Gemini Responded:

Of course. The explanation you received is functionally correct but can be confusing if you don't already know the terminology. Let's break down the DNS resolution process from the ground up, defining each component as we go. This will give you a solid foundation for your exam.

---

### ## 1. The Fundamental Goal of DNS

At its core, the **Domain Name System (DNS)** solves one simple problem: computers communicate using numerical IP addresses (like `142.250.196.100`), but humans prefer memorable names (like `www.google.com`). DNS acts as the internet's phonebook, translating the names we use into the numbers computers need.

---

### ## 2. The Key Players in DNS Resolution

Before we trace the path of a query, it's crucial to understand the role of each component. Think of them as characters in a play.

#### **Stub Resolver**
This is not a separate server but a small piece of software on **your own computer** (part of the operating system).
* **Job**: Its only job is to receive a DNS request from an application (like your web browser) and forward it to a real DNS server for resolution.
* **Knowledge**: It's simple—it doesn't know how to resolve anything itself. It just knows the address of the Recursive Resolver it's configured to use.
* **Analogy**: It's like a receptionist in an office who doesn't know the answer to your question but knows exactly which expert (the Recursive Resolver) to call to find out.

#### **Recursive Resolver (or DNS Recursor)**
This is the workhorse of the DNS process. It's a server, typically operated by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), a public provider like Google (`8.8.8.8`), or Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`).
* **Job**: To perform the complete resolution process on behalf of the Stub Resolver. It will "recurse" through the DNS hierarchy until it finds the final IP address.
* **Knowledge**: It knows how to contact the highest-level DNS servers (the Root Servers) to start its search. It also has a **cache** to remember recent lookups to speed things up.

#### **Root Name Server**
There are 13 logical root server clusters strategically placed around the world. They are the starting point for any DNS lookup where the answer is not already cached.
* **Job**: To direct traffic to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) server.
* **Knowledge**: It doesn't know the IP for `www.google.com`, but it knows where to find the servers that manage all `.com` domains. It manages the internet's root zone (`.`).

#### **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server**
These servers manage the next level of the hierarchy for domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.in`, etc.
* **Job**: To direct traffic to the specific domain's Authoritative Name Server.
* **Knowledge**: It doesn't know the IP for `www.google.com`, but it knows the address of the name servers that are the final authority for the `google.com` domain.

#### **Authoritative Name Server**
This is the final destination in the query chain. It's the server that holds the actual DNS records for a specific domain (e.g., `google.com`). A company's IT department or their domain registrar manages these records.
* **Job**: To provide the final answer—the IP address for the requested hostname.
* **Knowledge**: It is the **source of truth** for its specific domain. It has a list (a "zone file") that maps hostnames like `www` or `mail` to IP addresses.

---

### ## 3. The Step-by-Step Resolution Process (No Caching)

Let's trace the full journey for `www.google.com`, assuming no information is cached anywhere.



**Step 1: The Initial Request**
You type `www.google.com` into your browser. Your browser checks its own tiny cache—it's empty. It then asks the operating system, which triggers the **Stub Resolver**.
* **Query**: Browser -> Stub Resolver: "What is the IP for `www.google.com`?"

**Step 2: Stub to Recursive Resolver**
The **Stub Resolver** doesn't know the answer. It forwards the exact same question to its pre-configured **Recursive Resolver** (e.g., your ISP's DNS server at `210.212.227.70` or Google's at `8.8.8.8`). This is a **recursive query**: the stub is asking the recursive resolver to do all the work and only return the final answer.
* **Query**: Stub Resolver -> Recursive Resolver: "What is the IP for `www.google.com`?"

**Step 3: Recursive Resolver to Root Server**
The **Recursive Resolver** checks its cache—it's empty. It must start from the top. It sends a query to one of the 13 **Root Servers**. This is an **iterative query**: the resolver is not asking the root to find the whole answer, just for the next step.
* **Query**: Recursive Resolver -> Root Server: "Where can I find info on `www.google.com`?"
* **Response**: Root Server -> Recursive Resolver: "I don't know, but I know who manages `.com`. Here are the addresses for the `.com` TLD servers."

**Step 4: Recursive Resolver to TLD Server**
The **Recursive Resolver** now queries one of the `.com` **TLD Servers** it just learned about.
* **Query**: Recursive Resolver -> `.com` TLD Server: "Where can I find info on `www.google.com`?"
* **Response**: TLD Server -> Recursive Resolver: "I don't know the full answer, but I know who manages the `google.com` domain. Here are the addresses for `google.com`'s Authoritative Name Servers (e.g., `ns1.google.com`, `ns2.google.com`)."

**Step 5: Recursive Resolver to Authoritative Server**
The **Recursive Resolver** is now at the final step. It queries one of `google.com`'s **Authoritative Name Servers**.
* **Query**: Recursive Resolver -> Authoritative Server (`ns1.google.com`): "What is the IP for `www.google.com`?"
* **Response**: Authoritative Server -> Recursive Resolver: "I am the authority for this domain. The `A` record for `www.google.com` points to the IP address `142.250.196.100`."

**Step 6: The Journey Home**
The **Recursive Resolver** now has the final answer.
1.  It stores (caches) this `hostname -> IP` mapping for future requests, noting its **Time-To-Live (TTL)**—the duration for which the record is valid.
2.  It sends the IP address `142.250.196.100` back to the **Stub Resolver** on your computer.
3.  The Stub Resolver passes it to the operating system, which gives it to your browser.
4.  Your browser now knows the IP address and can establish a direct TCP connection to Google's server to request the webpage content. 🥳

---

### ## 4. The Critical Role of Caching

The process above seems long, and it is! It involves multiple round-trips across the internet. In reality, this full process rarely happens because of **caching**.

* **What is it?** Storing the answer to a DNS query locally so you don't have to ask again.
* **Why is it important?** It drastically reduces latency (making websites load faster) and reduces the load on the root, TLD, and authoritative servers.
* **Where does it happen?**
    1.  **Browser Cache**: The first place checked. Very fast, but temporary and specific to the browser.
    2.  **OS Cache (Stub Resolver Cache)**: The next place checked. Shared across all applications on your computer.
    3.  **Recursive Resolver Cache**: This is the most effective cache. If you and your neighbor use the same ISP, and you visit a site, when your neighbor tries a second later, the ISP's recursive resolver will answer instantly from its cache without querying any other servers.

---

### ## 5. Common DNS Record Types for Your Exam

The Authoritative Server doesn't just store IP addresses. It holds different types of records. Here are the most important ones:

| Record Type | Name                      | Purpose                                                                 | Example                                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **A** | Address Record            | Maps a hostname to an **IPv4** address (the most common type).          | `google.com` -> `142.250.196.100`           |
| **AAAA** | IPv6 Address Record       | Maps a hostname to an **IPv6** address.                                 | `google.com` -> `2404:6800:4009:820::200e`   |
| **CNAME** | Canonical Name Record     | Creates an **alias** from one hostname to another.                      | `www.example.com` -> `example.com`          |
| **MX** | Mail Exchange Record      | Specifies the mail servers responsible for accepting email for a domain. | `example.com` -> `10 mail.example.com`      |
| **NS** | Name Server Record        | Delegates a domain or subdomain to a set of authoritative name servers. | `example.com` -> `ns1.dns-provider.com`     |
| **TXT** | Text Record               | Allows an administrator to store arbitrary text in the DNS record.      | Used for email verification (SPF, DKIM), etc. |

By understanding these components and the logical flow of the query, you should be well-prepared to tackle any question on the DNS resolution process.

# You Asked:

can you make 10 problems with medium and higher difficultly levels with solutions that will help me cover everything you said - the whole topic of dns resolution

# Gemini Responded:

Of course. Here are 10 medium and high-difficulty problems designed to test your comprehensive understanding of the DNS resolution process. The solutions are provided below each question.

---

### ## Problems

**Problem 1 (Medium): Tracing a Non-`.com` Domain**
Trace the high-level iterative queries made by a recursive resolver for the hostname `mail.university.ac.in`. Assume no caches exist anywhere. For each step, identify which type of server is being queried and what kind of information is returned.

---

**Problem 2 (Hard): CNAME Record Resolution Path**
A company hosts its blog, `blog.mycompany.com`, on an external platform. To do this, they create a `CNAME` record that points `blog.mycompany.com` to `posts.platform.net`. Assuming no caches, detail the complete DNS resolution process a recursive resolver would have to undertake to find the final IP address for `blog.mycompany.com`. How does this differ from resolving a simple `A` record?

---

**Problem 3 (Medium): TTL and Caching Scenario**
An `A` record for `api.service.com` has a TTL (Time-To-Live) of 300 seconds. A user on your ISP makes a request for this domain at 2:00:00 PM.
1.  Another user on the same ISP requests `api.service.com` at 2:03:00 PM. From where is their request resolved?
2.  A third user on the same ISP requests it at 2:05:30 PM. From where is *their* request resolved? Explain your reasoning based on TTL.

---

**Problem 4 (Hard): Troubleshooting a Resolution Failure**
Users of a specific ISP in Bengaluru can access global sites like `google.com` and `github.com`, but they cannot access any websites ending in the `.co.uk` TLD. Users on other ISPs have no such problem. When they try to ping `bbc.co.uk`, they get an error like "cannot resolve host". What is the most likely single point of failure in the DNS hierarchy for these specific users, and why?

---

**Problem 5 (Medium): Practical DNS Configuration**
You are setting up DNS for a new domain, `fresh-eats.in`. You need to:
1.  Point the main domain `fresh-eats.in` to an IPv4 address `104.26.10.22`.
2.  Point the subdomain `www.fresh-eats.in` to the same IPv4 address.
3.  Designate Google's servers (`aspmx.l.google.com`, etc.) to handle all incoming email for the domain.
List the specific DNS records (Type, Name, Value) you would need to create.

---

**Problem 6 (Hard): NS Record Delegation**
The domain `my-cloud-app.com` is managed by Cloudflare's name servers. The company wants to host its own authoritative name servers for a special subdomain, `testing.my-cloud-app.com`, on servers with IPs `203.0.113.5` and `203.0.113.6`.
1.  What DNS records must be created in Cloudflare's DNS zone for `my-cloud-app.com` to delegate control of the `testing` subdomain?
2.  How does this change the query path for resolving `host1.testing.my-cloud-app.com`?

---

**Problem 7 (Medium): Impact of Root Server Failure**
Imagine a hypothetical scenario where all 13 logical root server clusters are unreachable for 24 hours. What would be the immediate impact on a typical internet user browsing the web? What would happen as time goes on, and why wouldn't the entire internet break instantly?

---

**Problem 8 (Hard): Caching Hierarchy Conflict**
A developer changes the IP address for `www.new-feature.io` from `1.1.1.1` to `2.2.2.2`. The `A` record's TTL was set to 1 hour (3600s). The developer flushes their own OS and browser DNS cache and sees the new site at `2.2.2.2` immediately. However, a user reports they are still seeing the old site hosted at `1.1.1.1`. What is the most likely reason for this discrepancy, and where is the outdated information being stored?

---

**Problem 9 (Medium): AAAA vs. A Records**
A client is on a modern computer that supports both IPv4 and IPv6. When they try to access `google.com`, which has both `A` (IPv4) and `AAAA` (IPv6) records, which IP address will the client's operating system typically prefer to use, and why?

---

**Problem 10 (Hard): The Role of the Stub Resolver**
Could a user's computer successfully resolve a DNS query if its configured recursive resolver (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) was offline, but the rest of the DNS system (Root, TLD, Authoritative servers) was perfectly functional? Explain the role of the **stub resolver** in your answer.

---
---

### ## Solutions

**Solution 1 (Medium): Tracing a Non-`.com` Domain**
The recursive resolver would perform the following iterative queries:
1.  **Query Root Server**: "Where can I find `.in` domains?" The Root Server responds with the IP addresses of the `.in` TLD name servers.
2.  **Query `.in` TLD Server**: "Where can I find `ac.in` domains?" The `.in` TLD server responds with the IP addresses of the `.ac.in` name servers (as `.ac` is a second-level domain in India).
3.  **Query `.ac.in` Name Server**: "Where can I find `university.ac.in`?" The `.ac.in` server responds with the IP addresses of the authoritative name servers for `university.ac.in`.
4.  **Query `university.ac.in` Authoritative Server**: "What is the IP for `mail.university.ac.in`?" The authoritative server returns the final `A` or `AAAA` record (the IP address).

---

**Solution 2 (Hard): CNAME Record Resolution Path**
1.  The resolution starts normally: Recursive Resolver queries Root -> TLD -> Authoritative server for `mycompany.com` asking for `blog.mycompany.com`.
2.  The authoritative server for `mycompany.com` does **not** return an IP address. Instead, it responds with a `CNAME` record: "`blog.mycompany.com` is an alias for `posts.platform.net`."
3.  The recursive resolver sees this response and must **start a new DNS resolution process from scratch** for the canonical name `posts.platform.net`.
4.  This new lookup involves querying Root -> `.net` TLD servers -> the authoritative name servers for `platform.net`.
5.  Finally, the authoritative server for `platform.net` is asked for the IP of `posts.platform.net` and returns the final `A` record.

**Difference**: A `CNAME` lookup requires at least two full DNS resolution cycles instead of one, adding latency to the user's request.

---

**Solution 3 (Medium): TTL and Caching Scenario**
1.  **At 2:03:00 PM**: The request is resolved instantly from the **recursive resolver's cache**. The initial request at 2:00:00 PM populated the cache, and the TTL of 300 seconds (5 minutes) means the entry is still valid.
2.  **At 2:05:30 PM**: The request will trigger a **full DNS lookup** starting from the root servers. The original cache entry from 2:00:00 PM expired at 2:05:00 PM (300 seconds later). Since the request came after the expiry time, the recursive resolver must fetch a fresh record.

---

**Solution 4 (Hard): Troubleshooting a Resolution Failure**
The most likely point of failure is the **ISP's recursive resolver's connection to (or cache of) the `.co.uk` TLD servers**.
* **Reasoning**: Since global sites like `google.com` work, the resolver can clearly reach the Root Servers and the `.com` TLD servers. The problem is specific to the `.co.uk` branch of the DNS tree. This suggests that when the ISP's resolver asks the Root Servers for the `.co.uk` TLD servers, it either receives a bad address, has a stale/corrupted cache entry for them, or has a network path issue preventing it from reaching them. Since users on other ISPs are fine, the `.co.uk` TLD servers themselves are not down; the issue is localized to the path from this specific ISP's resolver.

---

**Solution 5 (Medium): Practical DNS Configuration**
1.  `A` Record for the root domain:
    * **Type**: `A`
    * **Name**: `@` (or `fresh-eats.in`)
    * **Value**: `104.26.10.22`
2.  `A` Record for the `www` subdomain:
    * **Type**: `A`
    * **Name**: `www`
    * **Value**: `104.26.10.22`
    *(Alternatively, a `CNAME` record for `www` pointing to `fresh-eats.in` would also work).*
3.  `MX` Records for email:
    * **Type**: `MX`
    * **Name**: `@`
    * **Value**: `aspmx.l.google.com` (with a priority, e.g., 10)
    *(Multiple MX records for Google's other servers would also be added with different priorities).*

---

**Solution 6 (Hard): NS Record Delegation**
1.  **Records to create**: In Cloudflare's DNS for `my-cloud-app.com`, you must create two `NS` (Name Server) records for the `testing` subdomain.
    * Record 1: **Type**: `NS`, **Name**: `testing`, **Value**: `ns1.internal.example.com`
    * Record 2: **Type**: `NS`, **Name**: `testing`, **Value**: `ns2.internal.example.com`
    Additionally, you would need `A` records (called "glue records") that map `ns1.internal.example.com` to `203.0.113.5` and `ns2.internal.example.com` to `203.0.113.6`.
2.  **Query path change**: When resolving `host1.testing.my-cloud-app.com`, the recursive resolver will first query Cloudflare (the authoritative server for `my-cloud-app.com`). Instead of providing an IP, Cloudflare will see the `NS` records and respond with a **referral**: "I'm not the authority for the `testing` subdomain. You must ask `ns1.internal.example.com` or `ns2.internal.example.com`." The recursive resolver then queries one of those new name servers to get the final IP address.

---

**Solution 7 (Medium): Impact of Root Server Failure**
The internet would **not break instantly**.
* **Immediate Impact**: Most users would notice very little. The vast majority of DNS queries are resolved by caches on the user's OS or, more importantly, at the recursive resolver level (ISP/Google DNS). As long as the TLD server addresses are in the recursive resolver's cache, resolution for common domains (`.com`, `.org`) will continue to work perfectly.
* **Long-Term Impact**: As the TTLs for these cached TLD records begin to expire (typically 24-48 hours), recursive resolvers would be unable to refresh them. DNS lookups for domains they haven't seen recently would begin to fail. Over time, more and more of the internet would become inaccessible as these caches expire and cannot be repopulated.

---

**Solution 8 (Hard): Caching Hierarchy Conflict**
The most likely reason is that the user's request is being served by the **cache of their ISP's recursive resolver**.
* **Explanation**: When the developer flushed their local caches (browser/OS), their stub resolver sent a new query to their recursive resolver. It's possible the developer's recursive resolver didn't have the old record cached, so it fetched the new one (`2.2.2.2`).
* However, the user's recursive resolver had already looked up `www.new-feature.io` recently and had the old IP (`1.1.1.1`) in its cache. Because the TTL is 1 hour, that resolver will continue to serve the outdated IP to all of its users until the cache entry expires, regardless of any local cache flushing done by the end-user.

---

**Solution 9 (Medium): AAAA vs. A Records**
A modern, dual-stack (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6) operating system will **typically prefer the `AAAA` (IPv6) record**.
* **Reasoning**: IPv6 is the newer protocol designed to succeed IPv4. To encourage its adoption, standards (RFC 6724) dictate that clients should prefer connecting via IPv6 when both options are available. The OS will query for both `A` and `AAAA` records, and if it receives a valid `AAAA` response, it will attempt the IPv6 connection first.

---

**Solution 10 (Hard): The Role of the Stub Resolver**
No, the user's computer would **not** be able to resolve the query.
* **Explanation**: The **stub resolver** on the user's OS is not a full DNS client. Its only job is to forward DNS requests to the configured recursive resolver. It does not have the logic to perform iterative queries to the Root, TLD, and Authoritative servers by itself. If its one point of contact—the recursive resolver (`8.8.8.8` in this case)—is offline, the stub resolver has nowhere to send the query. The request will fail at the very first step, and the user will get a "server not found" or "host unreachable" error. The functionality of the rest of the DNS system is irrelevant if the first link in the chain is broken.
