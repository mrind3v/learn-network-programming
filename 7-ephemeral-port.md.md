## You asked:

i made a tcp server and client with socket module in python, i assigned host ip as 127.0.0.1 and port as 65432. the client connects to the same host ip and port. in the server.py file i also printed the addr of client as print(f"connected by {addr}") where conn, addr = s.accept(). but the addr port showed as 46040 instead of 65432, why?

Good question üëç

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

*   In **TCP**, a connection is uniquely identified by a **4-tuple**:
    
        (client_ip, client_port, server_ip, server_port)
        
    
*   On your **server** side:
    
    *   You **bind** your listening socket to `(127.0.0.1, 65432)`.
        
    *   That means the server will accept connections **coming to port 65432**.
        
*   On your **client** side:
    
    *   You tell it to connect to `(127.0.0.1, 65432)`.
        
    *   But the **client also needs its own port** to send/receive packets.
        
    *   If you don‚Äôt explicitly bind the client to a port, the OS automatically assigns it a **random unused "ephemeral port"** (often in the range ~49152‚Äì65535).
        
    *   In your case, the client got port `46040`.
        

So when you `print(addr)` on the server side:

    conn, addr = s.accept()
    print(addr)
    

`addr` is the **(client\_ip, client\_port)**, not the server‚Äôs port.

That‚Äôs why it shows:

    ('127.0.0.1', 46040)
    

instead of `65432`.

* * *

‚úÖ Summary:

*   **65432** is the server‚Äôs listening port.
    
*   **46040** is the ephemeral port automatically assigned to the client.
    
*   Together, the connection is:
    

    Client: 127.0.0.1:46040  <-->  Server: 127.0.0.1:65432
    

* * *

Would you like me to also show you **how to explicitly bind the client to a fixed port** (instead of letting the OS choose one)?
